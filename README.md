#### By _**Maldon Meehan, Epicodus**_

## Description

Create a meal tracking application. Users should be able to log foods they've eaten each day, including details about the meal and its number of calories. You may assume foods being logged are for a single day (you are not required to keep track of multiple days' meals).

User Stories

* I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
* I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
* I want options to view all foods
* I want to view only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
* I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository:
* In the command-line run:
```
$ npm install
```
```
$ bower install
```
```
install globals if needed (gulp, bower, sass, typescript, typescript packages.)

  $ npm install bower -g
  $ gem install sass
